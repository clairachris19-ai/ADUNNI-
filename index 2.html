    <div class="message">
        <span class="highlight">ADUNNI</span>, I just want to take a moment to appreciate you. You’ve been more than just a friend—you’ve been a constant support, a listening ear, and someone who genuinely cares. Even though you’re a girl, your strength, kindness, and encouragement have always inspired me, and I feel so lucky to have shared so many moments with you. Every laugh, every conversation, every bit of time we’ve spent together has meant so much to me. Thank you for being such a loyal and understanding friend. I truly cherish our friendship, and I hope we continue creating beautiful memories together for a long time.
